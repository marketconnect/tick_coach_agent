# # Agents with Human-in-the-Loop
# 
# We have an email assistant that uses a router to triage emails and then passes the email to the agent for response generation. We've also evaluated it. But do we fully *trust* it to manage our inbox autonomously? For such a sensitive task, human-in-the-loop (HITL) is important! Here we'll show how to add a human-in-the-loop to our email assistant so that we can review specific tool calls.

# 
# As you can see [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-inbox?tab=readme-ov-file#what-do-the-fields-mean), we format our interrupt with specific fields so that it can be viewed in Agent Inbox:
# 
# * `action_request`: The action and arguments for the interrupt with `action` (the action name) and `args` (the tool call arguments). This is rendered in the Agent Inbox as the main header for the interrupt event.
# * `config`: Configures which interaction types are allowed, and specific UI elements for each. 
# * `description`: Should be detailed, and may be markdown. This will be rendered in the Agent Inbox as the description

# #### Interrupt Handler
# 
# The `interrupt_handler` is the core HITL component of our response agent. 
# 
# Its job is to examine the tool calls that the LLM wants to make and determine which ones need human review before execution. Here's how it works:
# 
# 1. **Tool Selection**: The handler maintains a list of "HITL tools" that require human approval:
#    - `write_email`: Since sending emails has significant external impact
#    - `schedule_meeting`: Since scheduling meetings affects calendars
#    - `Question`: Since asking users questions requires direct interaction
# 
# 2. **Direct Execution**: Tools not in the HITL list (like `check_calendar_availability`) are executed immediately without interruption. This allows low-risk operations to proceed automatically.
# 
# 3. **Context Preparation**: For tools requiring review, the handler:
#    - Retrieves the original email for context
#    - Formats the tool call details for clear display
#    - Configures which interaction types are allowed for each tool type
# 
# 4. **Interrupt Creation**: The handler creates a structured interrupt request with:
#    - The action name and arguments
#    - Configuration for allowed interaction types
#    - A description that includes both the original email and the proposed action
# 
# 5. **Response Processing**: After the interrupt, the handler processes the human response:
#    - **Accept**: Executes the tool with original arguments
#    - **Edit**: Updates the tool call with edited arguments and then executes
#    - **Ignore**: Cancels the tool execution
#    - **Response**: Records feedback without execution
# 
# This handler ensures humans have oversight of all significant actions while allowing routine operations to proceed automatically. 
# 
# The ability to edit tool arguments (like email content or meeting details) gives users precise control over the assistant's actions.
# 
# We can visualize the overall flow:

# #### Review of HITL Patterns
# 
# **Triage Interruption** When an email is classified as "notify", the system interrupts to show the email to the human user
# - *User Decision*: User can choose to ignore the notification or provide feedback to respond to the email
# - *Flow Control*: If ignored, workflow ends; if user provides feedback, it flows to the Response Agent
# 
# **Write Email**: System shows proposed email draft for human review
# - *User Decision and Flow Control*: ignore (end workflow), respond with feedback, accept draft as-is, or edit draft
# 
# **Schedule Meeting**: System shows proposed meeting details for human review
# - *User Decision and Flow Control*: ignore (end workflow), respond with feedback, accept meeting details as-is, or edit details
# 
# **Question**: System asks user a question to clarify information
# - *User Decision and Flow Control*: ignore (end workflow) or respond with an answer

# What happened? We hit the [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/interrupts/), which paused execution at the tool call. You can see the `action` (tool call name) and `args` (tool call arguments) that we interrupted displayed to the user.
# 
# Now, how do we handle the interrupt? This is where the `Command` interface comes in. [The `Command` object has several powerful capabilities](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/command/). We used it to direct the flow of the graph in prior notebooks: 
# - `goto`: Specifies which node to route to next
# - `update`: Modifies the state before continuing execution
# 
# Here, we'll use it to resume the graph from the interrupted state:
# - `resume`: Provides the value to return from the interrupt call
# 
# We can return whatever value our graph is designed to handle. In our case, the graph is designed to handle a list of dicts with a single key `type` that can be `accept`, `edit`, `ignore`, or `response`. So, we can simply pass `{"type": "accept"}` to the `resume` argument in order to tell the graph that we accept the tool call.

# ### Interrupts Allow Us to Edit Tool Calls
# 
# This test demonstrates how human modification works in the HITL flow:
# 1. We start with the same tax planning email as before
# 2. The agent proposes a meeting with the same parameters
# 3. This time, the user EDITS the meeting proposal to change:
#    - Duration from 45 to 30 minutes
#    - Meeting subject is made more concise
# 4. The agent adapts to these changes when drafting the email
# 5. The user further EDITS the email to be shorter and less formal
# 6. The workflow completes with both modifications incorporated
# 
# This scenario showcases one of the most powerful aspects of HITL: 
# 
# * Users can make precise modifications to agent actions before they are executed, ensuring the final outcome matches their preferences without having to handle all the details themselves.

# 
# When the agent proposes the initial meeting schedule, we now simulate the user making modifications through the edit functionality. This demonstrates how the `edit` response type works:

# 1. The user receives the same meeting proposal as in the previous test
# 2. Instead of accepting, they modify the parameters:
#    - Reducing duration from 45 to 30 minutes
#    - Keeping the same day and time
# 3. The `edit` response includes the complete set of modified arguments
# 4. The interrupt handler replaces the original tool arguments with these edited ones
# 5. The tool is executed with the user's modifications
# 
# This shows how edit capability gives users precise control over agent actions while still letting the agent handle the execution details.

# %% [markdown]
# Edit the `write_email` tool call
# 
# After accepting the modified meeting schedule, the agent drafts an email reflecting the 30-minute duration. Now we demonstrate how editing works with email content:
# 
# 1. The agent has adapted its email to mention the shorter 30-minute duration
# 2. We simulate the user wanting an even more significant change to the email:
#    - Completely rewriting the content to be shorter and less formal
#    - Changing the meeting day mentioned in the email (showing how users can correct agent mistakes)
#    - Requesting confirmation rather than stating the meeting as definite
# 3. The `edit` response contains the complete new email content
# 4. The tool arguments are updated with this edited content
# 5. The email is sent with the user's preferred wording
# 
# This example shows the power of HITL for complex communication tasks - the agent handles the structure and initial content, while humans can refine tone, style, and substance.

# ### Interrupts Allow Us to Provide Feedback on Tool Calls
# 
# This test set demonstrates the "response" capability - providing feedback without editing or accepting:
# 
# 1. First, we test feedback for meeting scheduling:
#    - The user provides specific preferences (30 minutes instead of 45, and afternoon meetings)
#    - The agent incorporates this feedback into a revised proposal
#    - The user then accepts the revised meeting schedule
# 
# 2. Second, we test feedback for email drafting:
#    - The user requests a shorter, less formal email with a specific closing statement
#    - The agent completely rewrites the email according to this guidance
#    - The user accepts the new draft
# 
# 3. Lastly, we test feedback for questions:
#    - For the brunch invitation, the user answers the question with additional context
#    - The agent uses this information to draft an appropriate email response
#    - The workflow proceeds with the user's input integrated
# 
# The "response" capability bridges the gap between acceptance and editing - users can guide the agent without having to write the full content themselves. This is especially powerful for:
# - Adjusting tone and style
# - Adding context the agent missed
# - Redirecting the agent's approach
# - Answering questions in a way that shapes the next steps

# Now we explore the feedback capability for meeting scheduling:
# 
# 1. The agent proposes the standard 45-minute meeting on Tuesday at 2:00 PM
# 2. Instead of accepting or editing, we provide feedback in natural language
# 3. Our feedback specifies two preferences:
#    - Shorter meeting (30 minutes instead of 45)
#    - Preference for afternoon meetings (after 2pm)
# 4. The agent receives this feedback through the `response` type
# 5. The interrupt handler adds this feedback as a message to the state
# 6. The agent processes this feedback and generates a new tool call incorporating these preferences
# 
# Unlike direct editing, which requires specifying the entire set of parameters, feedback allows users to express their preferences conversationally. The agent must then interpret this feedback and apply it appropriately to create a revised proposal.

# After accepting the revised meeting schedule, the agent drafts an email. We now test feedback for email content:

#    - A less formal tone
#    - A specific closing statement about looking forward to the meeting
# 3. The agent processes this feedback to completely rewrite the email
# 4. The new draft is much shorter, more casual, and includes the requested closing
# 
# This demonstrates the power of natural language feedback for content creation:
# - Users don't need to rewrite the entire email themselves
# - They can provide high-level guidance on style, tone, and content
# - The agent handles the actual writing based on this guidance
# - The result better matches user preferences while preserving the essential information

# ### Interrupts Enable New Tools
# 
# Now let's try an email that calls the `Question` tool to provide feedback
# 
# Finally, we test how feedback works with the `Question` tool:
# 
# 1. For the brunch invitation email, the agent asks about preferred day and time
# 2. Instead of ignoring, we provide a substantive response with additional context:
#    - Confirming we want to invite the people mentioned
#    - Noting we need to check which weekend works best
#    - Adding information about needing a reservation
# 3. The agent uses this information to:
#    - Draft a comprehensive email response incorporating all our feedback
#    - Notice we didn't provide a specific day/time, so it suggests checking the calendar
#    - Include the detail about making a reservation
# 4. The complete email reflects both the original request and our additional guidance
# 
# This demonstrates how question responses can shape the entire workflow:
# - Questions let the agent gather missing information
# - User responses can include both direct answers and additional context
# - The agent integrates all this information into its next actions
# - The final outcome reflects the collaborative intelligence of both human and AI

# Our server it stateless. Threads with a local deployment are simply saved to the local filesystem (`.langgraph_api` in the project folder).
# 
# With a [hosted](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/deployment/#other-deployment-options) deployment, threads stored in Postgres.
# 
# Interrupted threads are threads with status 'interrupted', and we can see the interrupt in Studio: 
# 
# ![studio-img](img/studio-interrupt.png)
# 
# We'll use a custom interface to view these interrupted threads, [Agent Inbox](https://dev.agentinbox.ai/). 
# 
# This interface is a nice way to edit, approve, ignore, or provide feedback on specific actions taken by LangGraph agents. 
# 
# If you go to [dev.agentinbox.ai](https://dev.agentinbox.ai/), you can easily connect to the graph:
#    * Graph name: the name from the `langgraph.json` file (`email_assistant_hitl`)
#    * Graph URL: `http://127.0.0.1:2024/`
# 
# All interrupted threads run will then be visible: 
# 
# ![agent-inbox-img](img/agent-inbox.png)
# 
# Agent Inbox simply uses a `Command` with `resume`, as [shown with the SDK](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/wait-user-input/#interacting-with-the-agent) above, the resume the graph.
